## The Problem 
Lokie was inspired by the rate at which kidnapping situations has prevailed in Okitipupa community over the last few decades. 

## Solution
According to studies, in most kidnapping case, victims do have an average of 1-2 min to theirselves before taken away. Lokie gives you the super power to utilize this time just by clicking a button, and your loved one will get your real time location immediately.

## Core Feature
Lokie is suited with what we call a panic button, once the button is clicked, whoever you might have added as your trustee will be notified via email and notification on the mobile app to easily track your location.

If you feel this is **squicky**, you can easily block or delete your trustees. 

> The panic button also is made available via a sticky notification bar even when you are off lokie app,
it can be easily accessed.

## Other Features
* Location Sharing - Remotely share your location between 2-3 users with Google map.
* Explore Features - Get pictures of exciting places around you.
