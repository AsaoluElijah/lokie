## The Problem 
Lokie was inspired by the rate at which kidnapping situations has prevailed in Nigeria over the last few decades. 

## Solution
According to studies, in most kidnapping case, victims do have an average of 1-2 min to theirselves before taken away. Lokie gives you the super power to utilize this time just by clicking a button, and your loved one will get your real time location immediately.

## Core Feature
Lokie is suited with what we call a panic button, once the button is clicked, whoever you might have added as your trustee will be notified through a flash sms, email and notification on the mobile app to easily track your location.

If you feel this is **squicky**, you can easily block or delete your trustees. 

> The panic button also is made available via a sticky notification bar even when you are off lokie app,
it can be easily accessed.

## Other Features
* Location Sharing - Remotely share your location between 2-3 users.
* Explore Features - Get to know more about popular/rural cities with AR + VR experience.
